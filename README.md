# ❄️ Kill My Apps

Kill My Apps is a lightweight utility designed to terminate background processes, helping you **extend battery life**, **boost gaming performance**, and reclaim system resources.

To make the kill function work, [root] permission is necessary. Without it, you can keep using my app, but you have to stop apps manually by touching the target app and selecting "force stop".


## ✨ Features

- ⚡ **One-Click Optimization**: Terminate all background activities instantly.
- 🛡️ **Exclusion List**: Whitelist your important apps to keep them running.
- 🔍 **Smart Filtering**: Categorize apps by User, Launchable, or System processes.
- 🔋 **Battery Saver**: Reduce power consumption by eliminating idle app activities.
- 🎮 **Performance Boost**: Free up RAM and CPU for high-demand tasks like gaming.
- 📱 **Clean UI**: Simple and intuitive Material Design interface.
